# CheckAlphabet
Program to check wether a caracter is an alphabet or not.
In C programming, a character variable holds an ASCII value (an integer number between 0 and 127) rather than that character itself. 
The ASCII value of the lowercase alphabet is from 97 to 122. And, the ASCII value of the uppercase alphabet is from 65 to 90. 
If the ASCII value of the character entered by the user lies in the range of 97 to 122 or from 65 to 90, that number is an alphabet.
In the program, 'a' is used instead of 97 and 'z' is used instead of 122. Similarly, 'A' is used instead of 65 and 'Z' is used instead of 90. 
Note: It is better to check whether a character is an alphabet or not using the isalpha() function.
